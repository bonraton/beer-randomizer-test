## ToDo ideas
- [ ] Add Untappd Api. That will help user to dive in description and make better choice.
- [ ] Add small hint near IBU and BLG values. Not everybody know what is it.
- [ ] Add gender, beer volume and option to mix different beers in BAC calculator.

### Notes
About validation:
> - You can't enter more than 610 Kg in weight form. That's a weight of the heaviest person for last 40 years. If you are heavier, write me and I fix it.
> - You can't enter more than 77 in beer amount form. I found the world record is 77 glasses. Actually I don't believe that but let's imagine that's true.
